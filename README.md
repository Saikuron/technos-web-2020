# Chat application - final project

This project has been made by two students of ECE Paris in 4th year. It helped us working on react, nodeJS, dex and git. 
It is basically a chat application like messenger or whatsapp. You'll have the possibility to add channels, to modify your settings, to connect via mail adresses or GitHub accounts. Let's see how it works.

## Usage

* Clone this repository, from your local machine:
  ```
  https://github.com/Saikuron/technos-web-2020.git
  ```
* Install [Go](https://golang.org/) and [Dex](https://dexidp.io/docs/getting-started/). For example, on Ubuntu, from your project root directory:   
  ```
  # Install Go
  apt install golang-go
  # Download Dex
  git clone https://github.com/dexidp/dex.git
  # Build Dex
  cd dex
  make
  make examples
  ```
  Note, the provided `.gitignore` file ignore the `dex` folder.
* Make a copy of the Dex configuration to `./dex-config/config-private.yaml`, the project is configured to Git ignore this path:
  ```bash
  cp -rp ./dex-config/config.yaml ./dex-config/config-private.yaml
  ```
* Register your GitHub application, get the clientID and clientSecret from GitHub and report them to your Dex configuration. Modify the provided `./dex-config/config-private.yaml` configuration to look like:
  ```yaml
  - type: github
    id: github
    name: GitHub
    config:
      clientID: xxxx98f1c26493dbxxxx
      clientSecret: xxxxxxxxx80e139441b637796b128d8xxxxxxxxx
      redirectURI: http://127.0.0.1:5556/dex/callback
  ```
* Install the dependencies
  ```bash
  #Back-end
  cd back-end
  # Install dependencies (use yarn or npm)
  yarn install
  #Front-end
  cd ../front-end
  # Install dependencies (use yarn or npm)
  yarn install
  ```
* Start the app
  ```bash
  # Go back on the project source
  cd ..
  #Launch the start script that will launch dex, init and start the back-end, and start the front-end
  start
  ```
