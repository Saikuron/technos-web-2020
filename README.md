# ECE WebTech Chat

This is a chat application we wrote to learn the basics and the not so basics features of backend and frontend web programing. It leverages Node.js and React as well as complementary technologies such as unit testing with Mocha and Should.js, embeded storage with LevelDB, REST APIs, ... If we have time, we'll also play with GraphQL and Socket.io

## Installation

Clone the project and install the dependencies with the following commands in your terminal

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saikuron/technos-web-2020.git
cd technos-web-2020
npm install
```

To use the frontend you'll need to go in the frontend folder

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Usage

Start the web application:

```bash
node ./bin/start
Chat is waiting for you at http://localhost:3000
```

Run the tests with mocha:

```bash
npm run test
```

Use the frontend part like this

```bash
cd frontend
npm run start
```
